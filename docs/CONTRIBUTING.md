# Introduction
>First off, thank you for considering contributing to Random Quote App. You can make Random Quote App much better.

>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### Looking for
Improving code, documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials.

# Ground Rules
> * Ensure compatibility for every change that's accepted.
> * Ensure that code that goes into all linters.
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution
> Unsure where to begin contributing ? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
> Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
> Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
> Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

# Getting started
### Walkthrough.
>For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:
>1. Create your own fork of the code
>2. Do the changes in your fork
>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
> Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
> Send a pull request.

# How to report a bug
### Securiry vulnerarbilities
> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email olvetoshkin@gmail.com instead.
> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at olvetoshkin@gmail.com.

### Issue report.
> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
> 1. What did you do?
> 2. What did you expect to see?
> 3. What did you see instead?

# Code review process
### Explain how a contribution gets accepted after itâ€™s been submitted.
> I'm looking at Pull Requests on a regular basis.
> After feedback has been given I expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks, I may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
